# Firefox Add-on Validation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Icon Not Square (3 errors)
**Problem**: Original icon was 341x346 pixels (not square)
**Fix**: Created new 128x128 square icon
- Backed up original as `icon_original.png`
- Created simple square icon with clock/snooze theme

### 2. ✅ Service Worker Not Supported (1 warning)
**Problem**: Firefox doesn't support `service_worker` in manifest
**Fix**: Removed `service_worker` field, kept only `scripts` array in background section
```json
// Before:
"background": {
  "service_worker": "sw.js",
  "scripts": ["sw.js"]
}

// After:
"background": {
  "scripts": ["sw.js"]
}
```

### 3. ✅ Unsafe innerHTML Assignments (2 warnings)
**Problem**: Dynamic content was being inserted using innerHTML with user data
**Fix**: Replaced innerHTML with safe DOM manipulation methods
- Line 357: Replaced tab buttons innerHTML with createElement/appendChild
- Line 425: Replaced tab info innerHTML with safe text node creation
- This prevents XSS vulnerabilities and improves performance

### 4. ✅ Missing data_collection_permissions (1 warning)
**Problem**: Firefox now requires declaring data collection permissions
**Fix**: Added data_collection_permissions to browser_specific_settings
```json
"data_collection_permissions": {
  "storage": {
    "description": "Stores snoozed tab information locally to restore them later"
  }
}
```

## Result
All validation errors and warnings have been resolved. The extension now:
- Passes Mozilla's validation checks
- Is more secure (no XSS vulnerabilities)
- Follows Firefox best practices
- Ready for submission to Mozilla Add-ons
